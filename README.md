#### Introduction to Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of the brain, specifically the neural networks that make up the brain. It involves training artificial neural networks on a large dataset, allowing the network to learn and make intelligent decisions on its own. Deep learning has led to significant improvements in various fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and even healthcare.

#### Activation Functions
Activation functions are an essential component of neural networks. They determine the output of a neuron given an input or set of inputs. Activation functions can be linear or non-linear. Some popular activation functions include:

#### Sigmoid
Tanh
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
Leaky ReLU
Softmax
#### Loss Functions
Loss functions are used to evaluate the performance of a model, specifically in the context of training. The goal is to minimize the loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted output and the true output. Some popular loss functions include:

#### Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Cross-Entropy Loss
Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss
Optimization Algorithms
Optimization algorithms are used to minimize the loss function and improve the performance of the model. Some popular optimization algorithms include:

####Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
SGD is a simple and efficient optimization algorithm that involves updating the model weights in the opposite direction of the gradient of the loss function w.r.t. the weights, with a fixed learning rate.

#### Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
Mini-batch gradient descent is an extension of SGD that involves dividing the training dataset into mini-batches and using the average gradient of the mini-batch to update the model weights, rather than using the gradient of the entire dataset as in SGD.

#### Momentum
Momentum is an optimization algorithm that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations. It does this by adding a fraction of the update vector of the past time step to the current update vector.

#### Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)
NAG is an optimization algorithm that is similar to momentum, but it takes into account the future gradient information by looking ahead in the direction of the momentum.

#### Adagrad
Adagrad is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate to the parameters, performing larger updates for infrequent and smaller updates for frequent parameters
